**Conclusion / Analyst README**

This case study examined a forged TCP SYN packet using a spoofed internal IP address as its source. The attacker did not attempt to complete a session or deliver a payload — instead, they employed identity deception at the IP layer, crafting traffic designed to resemble trusted internal communication.

The activity did not escalate to a transport or application-layer interaction. No system compromise occurred, and the spoofed packet was not acknowledged from the attacker’s side. This IOC represents a network-layer ingress failure, where trust was implied by IP alone, not validated by handshake or authentication.

From a defensive perspective, this scenario reinforces the importance of:

Flow-level visibility using tools like NetFlow or IPFIX

Awareness of one-way TCP activity

Detecting internal IPs arriving from external interfaces

Contextual analysis of TTL anomalies and incomplete sessions

While IP spoofing is not inherently damaging on its own, it can support broader campaigns — including evasion of IP-based ACLs, trust probing, or transport-layer denial-of-service attacks. Recognizing and interpreting this type of low-yield, low-noise activity is part of a broader analytical skillset that underpins real-world intrusion detection and exam-aligned incident response logic.
